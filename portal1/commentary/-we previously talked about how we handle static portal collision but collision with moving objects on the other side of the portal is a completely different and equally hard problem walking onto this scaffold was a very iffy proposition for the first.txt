we previously talked about how we handle static portal collision but collision with moving objects on the other side of the portal is a completely different and equally hard problem walking onto this scaffold was a very iffy proposition for the first few months of development we solve the problem of colliding with these dynamic objects by cloning the objects from one portal to the other and strictly controlling what objects are allowed to collide with each other and how theyre allowed to collide
