during development wed often run across some piece of level design that would break the portal system for instance this ceilingtoceiling transition was an unexpected edge case that ended up requiring a lot of effort to make work we tried never to take the easy route of simply changing the level design to work with existing portal technology we knew that once the game was out in the wild custom map creators would stress the system in ways we hadnt even considered so we made it as flexible as possible
