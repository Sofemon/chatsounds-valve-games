for portal we wanted to create a turret that was different from the traditional hl turrets the hl turrets are nothing more than mindless mounted guns in portal we wanted the turrets to have personality to be characters the first step was a redesign of the look once we had the look of the new turrets they seemed less like menacing machine guns and more like cute robots and robots can never really be cute until they are talking robots so the next step was creating the vocal characteristics of the turrets working with ellen mc clain we settled on an innocent sounding voice with dialogue to match this juxtaposition of killing machine and innocent nonaggressive personality ends up making the portal turret a memorable character
