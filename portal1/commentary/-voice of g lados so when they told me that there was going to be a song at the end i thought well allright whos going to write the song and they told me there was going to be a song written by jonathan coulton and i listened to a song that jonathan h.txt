voice of g lados so when they told me that there was going to be a song at the end i thought well allright whos going to write the song and they told me there was going to be a song written by jonathan coulton and i listened to a song that jonathan had written and it was very funny very clever so i thought at that point well you know thisll be okay but i am an opera singer so usually i sing opera singing and i thought well will i be able to have the right style for the song so i was concerned but then before the recording they sent me an mp file of the song and i listened to it with jonathan singing it but i loved the little song and at home as i practiced the little song i tried to you know get back to g ladoss voice you know aperture science just this tiny little passiveaggressive computer whos all alone until people try to come in and murder her so of course she gets upset but she seems she seems to have this real affinity for cake and and i want to play the game because i want to recreate the cake recipe and then put portal on it and be able to serve it to my friends when they come over to my house
