we designed this room to draw the players eyes to the box the light from the observation room casts horizontal shadows that point at the box which is directly lit by a warm light from the ceiling this warm light helps the box stand out against the predominantly cool test chamber lighting the varying sized squares of the off limits surface also help direct the players attention upward
