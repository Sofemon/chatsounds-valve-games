voice of g lados as an actor you know you come in you do what youre told you want to make your money and sometimes you get good direction and sometimes you dont get good direction but it doesnt matter and you certainly dont tell the production team any of this but you come in and theyll you know theyll give you a lame line reading and youre supposed to find some emotional value in that but this is not what this team did they would come in for example and give me the direction explosively indignant thats a wonderful direction for an actor so i must say that the production team won me over because so often i get bogus direction but this time i was actually directed and had fun at all the sessions
