integrating portals with the source engines physics system was a complex process that required several iterations to achieve the right balance of performance and correctness because portals can be placed virtually anywhere in the game environment the physics system had to be modified to allow dynamic changes to its representation of colliding geometry such as the walls and floor around this box and any objects which may lie on the opposite side of the portal initial implementations of this dynamic collision generation system could take up to one half of one second or milliseconds to compute the correct collision this may not sound like a long time in everyday life but this pause during portal creation was quite noticeable in the context of the game ultimately we designed a system that creates temporary hybrid physics environments in bubbles around the portals using less accurate collision than that produced by sources standard collision generation but was accurate enough in practice and reduced the time to create the dynamic collision representation from milliseconds to just milliseconds which is an imperceptible pause during portal creation
