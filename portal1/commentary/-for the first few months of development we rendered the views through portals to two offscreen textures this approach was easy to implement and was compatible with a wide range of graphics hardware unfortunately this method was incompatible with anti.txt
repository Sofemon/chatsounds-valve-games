for the first few months of development we rendered the views through portals to two offscreen textures this approach was easy to implement and was compatible with a wide range of graphics hardware unfortunately this method was incompatible with antialiasing and consumed a large amount of video memory in order to handle recursive views through several portals because of these disadvantages we switched to a system which renders portal views recursively into the frame buffer with the aid of the stencil buffer to isolate pixels corresponding to a given portal this is a more effective scheme because it is compatible with antialiasing and does not consume any additional video memory for offscreen textures
