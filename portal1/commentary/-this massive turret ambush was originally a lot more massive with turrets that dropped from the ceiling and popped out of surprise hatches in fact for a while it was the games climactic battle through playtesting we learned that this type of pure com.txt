this massive turret ambush was originally a lot more massive with turrets that dropped from the ceiling and popped out of surprise hatches in fact for a while it was the games climactic battle through playtesting we learned that this type of pure combat experience didnt really fit with the preceding few hours of player training over several iterations we toned down the combat and made the room more about using portal momentum to fling yourself great distances a skill that playtesters really enjoyed using and thats a key component of what eventually became our final battle
