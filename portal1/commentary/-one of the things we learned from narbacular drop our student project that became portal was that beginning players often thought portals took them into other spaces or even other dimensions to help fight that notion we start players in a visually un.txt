one of the things we learned from narbacular drop our student project that became portal was that beginning players often thought portals took them into other spaces or even other dimensions to help fight that notion we start players in a visually unique room with memorable objects so that when they walk through a portal for the first time they have a clear point of reference which communicates the idea that theyre still in the same basic location for instance the radio which is playing an instrumental version of still alive helps as well by providing some audio continuity
