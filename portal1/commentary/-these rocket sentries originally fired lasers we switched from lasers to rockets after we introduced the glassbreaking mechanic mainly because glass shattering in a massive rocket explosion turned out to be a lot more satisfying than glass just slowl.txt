these rocket sentries originally fired lasers we switched from lasers to rockets after we introduced the glassbreaking mechanic mainly because glass shattering in a massive rocket explosion turned out to be a lot more satisfying than glass just slowly being melted by a laser originally they also spoke just like the bullet turrets because players often redirect the rockets with their backs to the turret however a distinct uncluttered sound cue was required the voice simply added too much noise to the rocket redirect mechanic
