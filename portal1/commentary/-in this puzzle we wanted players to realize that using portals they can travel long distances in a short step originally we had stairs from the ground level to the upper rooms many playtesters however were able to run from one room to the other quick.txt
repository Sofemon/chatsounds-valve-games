in this puzzle we wanted players to realize that using portals they can travel long distances in a short step originally we had stairs from the ground level to the upper rooms many playtesters however were able to run from one room to the other quickly enough to consider it a solution without ever thinking to use the even easier portal method by changing the stairs to very slow moving lifts we were able to level the travel time for all player experience levels thus making the intended solution more clear
